              <h3>Women & Power: A Manifesto by Mary Beard</h3></br>
              <form class="artikel1" action="index.html" method="post">
                <p>This book is a mere slip of a thing: at 115 pages, small enough to fit into the most diminutive of bags or even (should you be in striding out mood) the pocket of an overcoat. But size, in this instance, is irrelevant. There are two things you need to know about it. The first is that what Mary Beard has to say is powerful: here are more than a few pretty useful stones for the slingshots some of us feel we must carry with us everywhere we go right now..</p>

              <h3>Racism</h3></br>
              <form class="artikel1" action="index.html" method="post">
        <p>
        Racism is the belief that characteristics and abilities can be attributed to people simply on the basis of their race and that some racial groups are superior to others. Racism and discrimination have been used as powerful weapons encouraging fear or hatred of others in times of conflict and war, and even during economic downturns.

        <p>
          In a short introductory video the Understanding Race project from the American Anthropological Association says race is a powerful idea and an enduring concept, invented by society. It has also fostered inequality and discrimination for centuries, as well as influencing how we relate to other human beings.

              <h3>What Young People Think about Access to Reproductive Care</h3></br>
              <form class="artikel1" action="index.html" method="post">
                <p>
                  After three days of discussions, the youth representatives finalized the policy recommendation document titled “Adolescents’ Recommendation” with the support of facilitators from UNICEF, UNFPA, Rutgers WPF Indonesia and other youth-led organizations. The Recommendation covered three key areas: regulation, outreach to adolescents, and outreach to married adolescents.  
                  Of the 28 recommendations, one was particularly controversial – making contraceptives available to all. While one group thought universal access was needed to protect all sexually-active youth against teen pregnancy, another group argued that sex should only be for married couples.

                  Ambar Rahayu, who oversees family wellbeing and empowerment at BKKBN, stressed the importance of working together to improve reproductive health outcomes for adolescents. “Collaboration across ministries, with NGOs, the international community and the private sector is key to making change happen,” she said. “It’s not about blaming or eliminating an opinion that is different from yours. We have to foster understanding instead.”
