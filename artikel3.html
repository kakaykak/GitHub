                <p>
                  Thinking about this made me recall my experience at the National Adolescent Summit in Yogyakarta in March 2017 which aimed to address the issue of unplanned teen pregnancy.  
                </p>
                <p>
                 Some 70 young people, selected from 25 of Indonesia's 34 provinces, engaged in intense discussions on adolescent reproductive health access with representatives from the Government of Indonesia, UN agencies and NGOs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Naturally, in the "Twitter Capital of the World", debates spilled over onto social media. It was amazing to see young people boldly voicing their opinions and taking a stand on these sensitive issues, both online and offline.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  The three-day summit was jointly hosted by the National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN), John Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (JHCCP) and the Gates Foundation. U-Report, a youth polling platform, was used to give adolescents who could not attend a chance to have their voices heard. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  By presenting the opinions of youth to policy makers at the summit, U-Report used social media to amplify thousands of young people’s voices. These voices were able to feed into the formulation of the Adolescents' Recommendation ensuring policy makers have heard them loud and clear.
